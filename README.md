sns (shopNswap) is a project designed to address the gap in university platforms that facilitate the buying, selling, renting, and borrowing of goods and services among students within campus premises. The platform aims to create a convenient, safe, and accessible space for students to engage in transactions with each other, promoting sustainability and community within the university environment.
